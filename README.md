# machine-learning-challenge

  I used three different models for classification of an object as an exoplanet or not: a decision tree model, random forest model, and deep neural network model. The features I selected from the data set were:
  - koi_period: The time interval between planetary transits
  - koi_prad: The radius of the object
  - koi_fpflag_nt: A true/false flag for whether an object's light curve is consistent with a transiting planet
  - koi_steff: The temperature of the object's photosphere
